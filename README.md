This starter is a collection of libraries and approaches needed for fast start and productive maintainance of React Native App.

## Getting Started

### Quick start with [cli-rn](https://github.com/kanzitelli/cli-rn)

```bash
npx cli-rn new App -t rnn
```

> As `cli-rn` uses `react-native-rename` script for renaming under the hood, please refer to [Rename](#rename) section to apply necessary changes to Android part.

If you have any troubles running the app with `yarn ios` or `yarn android`, open XCode or Android Studio and run the project from there.

<details>
<summary>Manual setup</summary>

1. Clone the repo

```bash
npx degit kanzitelli/rnn-starter app
```

2. Install packages and pods

```bash
cd app && yarn && yarn ios:pods
```

3. Run it

Open XCode or Android Studio to run the project (recommended) or do

```bash
yarn ios
yarn android
```

</details>

### Rename

If you need to rename the app, do the following (based on [react-native-rename](https://github.com/junedomingo/react-native-rename)):

```bash
yarn rename "NewApp" -b com.yourcompany.newapp
yarn ios:pods
```

‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting on Android. You can see that after running `rename` script, it doesn't change package name and imports for files under `newarchitecture` folder.

<details>
<summary>You will need do these steps manually</summary>

1. Open all `.java` files under `android/app/src/main/java/your/bundle/newarchitecture/` folder.

2. Open `MainApplication.java`.

3. Find all packages and imports which contain `com.rnnstarter` and change them to yours.

## What's inside

- [React Native Navigation](https://github.com/wix/react-native-navigation) - truly native navigation experience for iOS and Android.
- [Expo Modules](https://github.com/expo/expo) - libraries and modules from [Expo](https://expo.dev) ecosystem.
- [RNN Screens](https://github.com/kanzitelli/rnn-screens) - simplifed and predictable Navigation for React Native. Built on top of [React Native Navigation](https://github.com/wix/react-native-navigation).
- [RN UI lib](https://github.com/wix/react-native-ui-lib) - amazing Design System, UI toolset & components library for React Native. Dark Mode is implemented using this library.
- [Reanimated 2](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-reanimated) - React Native's Animated library reimplemented.
- [MMKV](https://github.com/mrousavy/react-native-mmkv) - efficient, small mobile key-value storage framework developed by WeChat. [~30x faster](https://github.com/mrousavy/react-native-mmkv#benchmark) than _AsyncStorage_!
- [MobX](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx) - simple, scalable state management, with [mobx-persist-store](https://github.com/quarrant/mobx-persist-store) for persisting your stores.
- [Flash List](https://github.com/Shopify/flash-list) - a better list for React Native (by Shopify).
- [Fast Image](https://github.com/DylanVann/react-native-fast-image) - performant React Native image component.
- [React Native Vector Icons](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons) - customizable icons for React Native.
- [React Native Gesture Handler](https://github.com/kmagiera/react-native-gesture-handler) - native touches and gesture system for React Native.

#### Extra helpful libraries

- [React Native Navigation Hooks](https://github.com/underscopeio/react-native-navigation-hooks) - a set of hooks for React Native Navigation.
- [Patch Package](https://github.com/ds300/patch-package) - useful for fixing node modules instantly.
- [Release It](https://github.com/release-it/release-it) - automate versioning and publishing of your app.

#### Useful services/methods

- `navigation` - a service where some of navigation configuration takes place in (such as default options).
- `translate` - a service that brings an easy integration of localization for an app by using [i18n-js](https://github.com/fnando/i18n-js) and [expo-localization](https://github.com/expo/expo/tree/master/packages/expo-localization).
- `api` - a service where API-related methods are located.
- `onStart` - a service where you can write your own logic when app is launched. For example, you can increment number of `appLaunches` there.

#### Design system

This starter is using [RN UI lib](https://github.com/wix/react-native-ui-lib) as a design system, UI toolset and a source of ready-to-go components.

`configureDesignSystem()` - a method where all settings for an app's design system is taking place. You can customize colors, schemes, typegraphy, spacings, etc. Located at `src/utils/designSystem.tsx`.

## Advantages

#### Describe app screens in one place

All setup for your screens takes place in one file `src/screens/index.ts`:

```tsx
import {generateRNNScreens} from 'rnn-screens';

import {Main} from './main';
import {Settings} from './settings';

export const screens = generateRNNScreens(
  {
    Main: {
      component: Main,
      options: {
        topBar: {
          ...withTitle('Main'),
          ...withRightButtons('inc', 'dec'),
        },
      },
    },
    Settings: {
      component: Settings,
      options: {
        topBar: {
          ...withTitle('Settings')
        },
      },
    },
    // ...
  },
  [withGestureHandler, withStores, withServices, withAnotherProvider],
);
```

#### Navigate with predictability

```tsx
import {screens} from '.';

const SomeScreen = ({componentId}) => {
  const {nav} = useServices();

  return (
    <View>
      <Button
        label="Open screen"
        onPress={() => {
          // IDE will autocomplete with registered screens
          screens.push(componentId, 'AnotherScreen');
        }}
      />
    </View>
  );
};
```

#### Build root component with ease

```tsx
// single screen app
const App = () => Root(Screen(screens.get('Main')));

// tab based app
const TabsApp = () =>
  Root(
    BottomTabs([
      Screen(screens.get('Main')),
      Screen(screens.get('Playground')),
      Screen(screens.get('Settings')),
    ]),
  );
```

#### Dark mode support

You can define modes in `utils/designSystem.tsx`.

#### Samples for new screens, services, stores and components.

So you have one structure within the project. You can find them in corresponding folders. Just copy&paste it and make the necessary changes.

## Known issues

- **[iOS]** _Hermes framework not found/loaded_. There are some cases when `hermes.framework` is not found/loaded in XCode with React Native 0.70. Check [this comment](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/34601#issuecomment-1243232921) for potential solution.
- **[iOS]** _Large title is not shown on 2nd+ tab_. This [issue](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-screens/issues/649) exists. You can find the patch file for fixing that at `patches/react-native+0.70.0.patch`.
- **[Android]** _Issue after renaming on Android_. This happens when you [rename](#rename) the app using `yarn rename` script. Check [Rename](#rename) section for possible solution.

## Why

...do we need yet another starter/boilerplate? Well, I work with React Native for more than 4 years and during the time I started having my own project structure which was a good fit for almost all of the delivered apps. Also, I have come up with some custom [useful services/methods](#useful-servicesmethods) which simplify usage of [React Native Navigation](https://github.com/wix/react-native-navigation) and other libraries. Check out [Advantages](#advantages) section.
